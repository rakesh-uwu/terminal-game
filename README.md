# Advanced Ping Pong Game

## Description

Advanced Ping Pong is a browser-based implementation of the classic table tennis game. This project features a responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices, with customizable difficulty levels and intuitive controls.

The game pits the player against a computer-controlled opponent with adaptive AI that predicts ball trajectories and responds accordingly. The physics system calculates realistic ball bounces based on where the ball hits the paddle, creating varied and engaging gameplay.
